###

<p align="left">Welcome to the Text Summarization project! This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to create an advanced text summarization model. The goal is to generate concise and meaningful summaries of text documents, making it easier to extract key information quickly.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">🛠 Getting Started</h2>

###

<p align="left">This project leverages open-source libraries like TensorFlow, Transformers, and Hugging Face Datasets. Refer to their respective documentation and tutorials for detailed usage instructions.<br><br>Its just simple 3 steps :<br><br>1. Download the XSum Dataset (Train, Test, Validate)*📦🔽<br>   Use the `Xsum_download.ipynb` file to download the dataset. Once done, your model will have plenty of data to learn from! <br><br>2. Unleash the Text Summarizer with  Magic! 🪄📚<br> Open projrct and run to download dependecies ! <br> pip install -r requirements.txt  <br>  <br>3. Unleash the Text Summarizer with Emoji Magic! 🪄📚<br>   Open `interface/Gradio/Interface.ipynb` to transform lengthy text into concise summaries.<br><br>📂 Project Links<br><br>XSum Dataset<br>Hugging Face :  <br>https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum<br><br>Git repo :<br>https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/XSum/blob/master/XSum-Dataset/README.md<br><br><br></p>

<h2 align="left">🚀 Project Goals</h2>

###

<p align="left">📚 Implement a text summarization model using a pre-trained deep learning architecture like BART or T5.<br>📰 Leverage the XSum dataset for training the model, consisting of news articles and their corresponding human-written summaries.<br>📊 Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like ROUGE.<br>📝 Explore additional functionalities like abstractive summarization.</p>

<h2 align="left">🔧 Technical Approach</h2>

###

<p align="left">1.🤖 Deep Learning Model:<br>Utilize a pre-trained transformer-based model like BART or T5.<br>Fine-tune the model on the XSum dataset for text summarization.<br><br>2.🧹 Data Preprocessing:<br>Download and preprocess the XSum dataset:<br>Clean the text data (e.g., remove noise, punctuation).<br>Tokenize the text (convert words into sequences of numerical representations).<br>Prepare the data for model training (e.g., split into training, validation, and test sets).<br><br>3.🏋️‍♂️ Model Training:<br>Train the deep learning model on the preprocessed XSum dataset.<br>Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.) for optimal performance.<br><br>4.🔍 Evaluation:<br>Evaluate the trained model on unseen text data using metrics like ROUGE.<br>ROUGE compares the generated summaries with human-written references to assess how well they capture the key information.<br><br>5.🌐 Deployment (Optional):<br>Explore options for deploying the trained model as a web service or API for on-demand summary generation.</p>
